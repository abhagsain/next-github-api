## CORS is 💔 Next.js is ♥

Are you frustrated with the CORS error while using Github Jobs API?

Use [this URL](https://github-api-next.vercel.app/api/positions) to get the data without the headache.

You can pass all the query params that main API supports. [See it here](https://jobs.github.com/api)

Uses Next.js API routes to get the data from the main [Github Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/positions.json) so you don't have to bang your head for CORS error.

Thanks to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) it only took 5 minutes.
